<h4 id="notes-on-the-illyrians">Notes on the Illyrians.</h4>
<p>Early Illyrian references:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pomponius Mela, Chronographia: <em>Hadriaticum latus Illyris occupat</em>.</li>
<li>Sextus Propertius: Elegies, book 1, poem 8a: <em>An tibi sum gelida vilior Illyria?</em></li>
<li>From the Historia Augustia: A letter from emperor Valerian to Zosimio: _claudium Illyricianae gentis virum, tribunum Martiae quintae legioni fortissimae dedimus.</li>
<li>From a coin dated to the reign of emperor Decius. The inscription reads <em>GENIUS EXERC. ILLURICIANI S. C.</em> Catalogued by Francesco Maria Mezzabarba in <em>Imperatorum Romanorum Numismata</em>. Page 353.</li>
</ol>
<p>Illryian Origins:</p>
<ol>
<li>Appian of Alexandria: A son of Polyphemus named Illyria who conquered the land. He admits the claim may be a fable.</li>
<li>Apollodorus: Cadmus had a son name Illyrius. Stephanus of Byzantium and Eustathius of Thessalonica mention this claim.</li>
<li>Samuel Bochart (1599-1667) thought the term Illyria to be a Phoenician term (the language of the Cadmeans).</li>
<li>A second story from Appian, That Hercules received the land of Illyria from Dyrrhachus for coming to his rescue. The land was then inherited by his son Hyllus. Farlati thinks over time the word for the region shifted: From <em>Hyllo</em> to <em>Hyllini</em> to <em>Hyllinis</em> to Illyrii</li>
<li>Farlati says Nicephorus Xanthopoulos (1256-1335) mentioned a document (he does not say in what source) that referred to Salona by the name Hyllae</li>
</ol>
<p>Successors of Hyllus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Varro mentions an Illyrian king Clinicus in a lost work <em>Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum</em>. Farlati takes the reference from Valerius Probus.</li>
<li>Farlati believes Daunus succeeded Clinicus. He is described by Antoninus Liberalis in Metamorphoses as having established the Daunians in Italy with settlers from Illyria. Pliny the Elder mentions the tribe in Natural History, book II. Strabo mentions them in his Geography.</li>
</ol>
<p>original boundaries:
Between the Neretva and Drin river. In latin referred to as the <em>Naron</em> and <em>Drilon</em>. Later expanded to the Krka river, in Latin referred to as the <em>Titius</em>.</p>

</ol>
<h5 id="notes-on-apostlic-origins-in-illyria">Notes on Apostlic origins in Illyria.</h5>
<p>Peter in Illyria?</p>
<ol>
<li>Peter traveled to Rome at some point. No definitive evidence that he passed through Illyria Proper.</li>
<li>From a manuscript entitled Monumenta Urbis Fani: Peter arrived in Italy from Dalmatia.</li>
<li>From Landus Ferretius: Peter came from Dalmatia to Anconia where he stayed a few days.</li>
<li>Petrus de Natalibus: Peter left Anconia and arrived in Naples.</li>
<li>The Commentary on Peter and Paul, sometimes attributed to Simeon the Metaphrast: Peter went to Macedonia, then all the way down to corinth, over to Sicility, then up to Rome.</li>
<li>A report by Cassius Dio in the same year that Peter is said to have travelled to Rome: The governer of Dalmatia, Furius Camillus Scrionianus, led a rebellion, but was quelled within 5 days when the army stopped listening to him. Suetonius in his Life of Claudius: <em>his rebellion was put down within five days, since the legions which had changed their allegiance were turned from their purpose by superstitious fear&quot;.</em> the 5th century Paulus Orosius thought the &ldquo;superstitious fear&rdquo; to be Peter&rsquo;s arrival in Rome. Farlati thinks it might have been Peter&rsquo;s arrival in dalmatia itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Paul in Illyria?</p>
<ol>
<li>Romans 15:19 <em>so from Jerusalem all the way around to Ilyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ</em>. Many writers view this as inclusive of Illyria.</li>
<li>Psuedo Jerome in epistle 148: <em>Thomas in India, Peter in Rome, Paul in Illyria</em>.</li>
<li>Gregory of Nyssen: <em>&hellip;as to leave no place inaccessible to the Christian stronghold; hence the Egyptians, Syrians, Parthians, and Mesopotamians, Italians and Gauls, Illyrians and Macedonians&hellip;</em></li>
<li>Asterius of amasea in homily 8: <em>Paul, traveling through all Illyria, and scattering everywhere the sparks of the stars, which the auspiciuous Spirit raised up, and always kept alive</em>.</li>
<li>John VIII epistle 76 to Count Peter: <em>Thus the holy roman church founded in this country with his own blood, with Paul, who from Jerusalem to Illyricum, that is, the region in which you now dwell [bulgaria], filled with the Gospel, consecrated it to the Lord god, and dedicated it</em>.</li>
<li>Peter of Marchia: <em>Paul, having traversed the regions of Judea, Syria, Asia, Macedonia, Achaia, and Illyria, and having exhausted his many labors in the foundations of churches, came to the city of rome as an intrepid herald of religion</em>.</li>
<li>Alphonso Salmeron: Paul mentions those regions in Romans 15 to solidify himself as Apostle of the Gentiles.</li>
<li>Johannes Lucius in his history of Dalmatia reports a legend that Paul preached alongside the Krka river where the monastery now stands. The monastery contained a slavonic wooden epigraph that marked the arrival of Paul. Alberto Fortis some years later described the epigraph as a picture of Paul preaching to the Dalmatians, stating that those being preached to were in the local customy clothes.</li>
<li>Marin Barleti in his biography on Skanderbeg, testifies to marble monuments attesting to the arrival of Paul in Albania.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4 id="2-of-the-disciples-of-christ-or-the-apostles-who-spread-christianity-among-the-illyrians-255">2. Of the disciples of Christ or the Apostles, who spread Christianity among the Illyrians. 255</h4>
<ol>
<li>Of the Illyrian Apostolate of Clement, Luke, and Apollinaris.</li>
<li>Of other Illyrian evangelical followers of Christ or the Apostles.</li>
<li>Of Titus and Hermes, Apostles and Bishops of Dalmatia.</li>
<li>Of Domnius, Disciple of Peter, Apostle of Dalmatia, and First Bishop of Salona.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="notes-on-disciples-in-illyria">Notes on disciples in Illyria.</h5>
<ol>
<li>In one version of the acts of Domnius, Clement travels to Salona to appoint successors.</li>
<li>Citing a work titled <em>life of Clement</em> said to be by the Salonan bishop Hesychius. Clement wrote a letter that was read in the churches of Dalmatia.</li>
<li>Epiphanius of Salamis is the source of a tradition that Luke preached in Dalmatia and Macedonia after Paul&rsquo;s death.</li>
<li>Apollinaris of Ravenna, said to be a disciple of Peter, was exiled to Illyria. The story is told in the <em>Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis</em>.</li>
<li>Timothy by association of being Paul&rsquo;s travelling companion.</li>
<li>Caesar, of Phil 4:22, traditionally held to be the first bishop of Dyrrachium, Albania.</li>
<li>Citing again the <em>life of Clement</em>. Cornelius the centurion is said to be born in Siscia, modern day Sisak, Croatia. No other sources are known to give a location of birth.</li>
<li>Constantino Porphyrogenitus (10th century) in <em>De Administrando Imperio</em> is the first to suggest Paul&rsquo;s shipwreck in Acts 28:1 is not the island of Malta but the Illyrian island of Meleta, today known as Mljet. Charles ellicot and other 19th century commentators note that the theory was revived in the 18th century by a native monk of the Mljet, Padre Georgi and reject it entirely.</li>
<li>Ignatius of Antioch, a hearer of John, passes through Macedonia on his way to Rome. The apochryphal <em>Martyrium Ignatii</em> add that from Macedonia he walked west to Epidamnos, modern day Durres, Albania, and crossed the Adriatic sea to Italy.</li>
<li>Farlati finds among the papers of Šimun Kožičić Benja (lt. Simon Bengnius) the claim that marcella, the servant of Martha was from Siscia.</li>
<li>Titus, mentioned by Paul as being in Dalmatia in 2 Timothy 4:10.</li>
<li>Hermes of Romans 16:14. A list of Disciples by Pseudo-Hippolytus lists Hermes as Bishop of dalmatia.</li>
<li>Domnius, called a Disciple of Peter by Farlati. Research in the 19th and 20th century make for a stronger case that Domnius lived in the 4th century.</li>

<p>The <em>acts</em> say that Domnius was born in Antioch. He was baptized there by Peter and followed him until directed to go to Salona. He established a church there. The pagan priests complained to a certain prefect named <em>Maurilius</em>, who had Domnius imprisoned and ordered to be put to death. Several Christians are said to have shown up to the execution and revolted. They were beheaded as punishment. Domnius is freed and The <em>acts</em> continue by saying Domnius raised the son of a widow named Febronia. The pagan priests again go to Maurilius, bribing him to arrest Domnius a second time. The story concludes with Domnius bowing in prayer and being beheaded.</p>

<li>Donatus.
<ol>
<li>from Pluteo 9. Codice 14 in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana collection. The scans of this 800 page manuscript are available <a href="https://tecabml.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/plutei/id/314430/rec/641">online</a>.</li>
<li>Daniel Cardonus published a latin translation in the <em>Acta Sanctorum</em>. Partially Available <a href="https://archive.org/details/actasanctorum18unse/page/n383/mode/2up">here</a>.</li>
<li>The acts say that Donatus was born in an Istrian city in Dalmatia that bordered Pannonia. He became a priest in Aquila where his defense of Christianity garnered him some fame. As Christian persecution intensifies, he flees to a mountain near Salona. After some time the emperor Diocletian comes to the mountain to offer sacrifices, but is told the oracles are receiving interference from a Christian residing on the mountain. Donatus is found in a cave and brought out, where he gives his defense of Christianity. Inspired by dreams, two of Diocletian&rsquo;s officials, Marcarius and Theodore, return to Donatus the next day and are converted. The three are unharmed when ordered fed to the wild beasts. An earthquake allows them to escape to Egypt where they were eventually martyred.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Anastasius the Fuller.
<ol>
<li>Said also to be from Aquila. Martyred in Salona.</li>
<li>Farlati publishes 3 versions of his Acts.
<ol>
<li>A manuscript found in the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel, France. Farlati is wanred by the sender that this manuscript contains errors elsewhere.</li>
<li>A manuscript in the collection of Apostolo Zeno.</li>
<li>A slavonic manuscript, otherwise unknown.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Anastasius, a fuller by trade, feels called to travel to Salona during the Diocletian persecution. He paints a cross above the door of his residence. The city officials seeing this have Anastasius flogged, tie a stone around his neck and throw him in to the sea. During their search they come across a group of sailors who have recovered the body. The slaves threaten the sailors to return the body or they will report them as the ones who committed the act. The sailors return the body but keep the stone. They are said to have taken the stone, in one version to Africa, in another to Aquila, and built a temple for it. The body of Anastasius is given to the woman, who keeps it until the persecution ends. She then builds a temple in Salona to house his relics.</li>
<li>The relics were eventually transferred from Salona to Split and kep in the cathedral. Farlati insists that the relics of this Anastasius remain in the cathedral, and that the other Anastasius was taken to Rome by the Abbott Martin.</li>
