  <p>This is part 23 in a series on Daniel Farlati&rsquo;s <a href="../../">Illyricum Sacrum</a>.</p>
<p>Guncellus, also referred to as Göncöl or Gonzello, served as Archbishop of Spalato roughly 20 years between 1218 and 1242 AD. The primary source of his life comes from his contemporary Thomas the Archdeacon. Thomas was in frequent conflict with Guncellus and would depict him negatively in his history of the bishops of Salona.</p>
<p>Thomas says that the towns people originally rejoiced at Guncellus&rsquo; arrival. The seat of the archbishop had been vacant for some time. Guncellus however, was inexperienced and lacking in wisdom. He proved to be unpopular among the people. Pope Honorius III writes to the people of Salona, saying he will allow the election if Robert, Bishop of Veszprém <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  deems him worthy of consecration. Robert consecrates him. Thomas reacts to the event negatively, saying he did not examine him close enough. Farlati Publishes 3 other letters from Honorius concerning local church affairs.</p>
<h3 id="aconcius-against-the-omiš-pirates">Aconcius against the Omiš pirates</h3>
<p>The next chapter details the arrival of the papal legate Aconcius in Spalato. Originally from Viterbo, Italy, Honorius sent him to deal with the Omiš pirates. The pirates had grown powerful and were operating south of Spalato in the Adriatic Sea. Thomas says that Aconcius granted indulgences to anyone who would help him counter the pirates. He was able to assemble a navy together to counter the pirates who eventually begged for peace.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Aconcius spent time in Salona correcting the church, because Guncellus was too inexperienced to do so himself. He reported this to Rome, and Guncellus nearly was stripped of his title. He pleaded for mercy, and was ordered to be suspended for two years. He spent one year of suspension in Rome, and as a result of good behavior was allowed to return to his office early.</p>
<p>Aconcius left Spalato for Bosnia. While Guncellus was away in Hungary, Spalato elected a count by the name of Peter, who sympathized with Catharism. Aconcius ordered an interdict against the city, halting church functions. However, Guncellus resumed church functions when he returned from Hungary. He does not seem to have been punished for this, perhaps because Aconcius is said to have died in Bosnia not long after.</p>
<p>Some time later, a bandit named Tollenius and his brother Ulcetta came to Guncellus and asked to build a fort near the village of Saint Domnius, promising they would leave Spalato in peace. Against objects, Guncellus permitted the fort to be built. The brothers and their followers went back on their word and terrorized the city. Count Peter Assembled an army of 3,000 to attack the fort and forced the bandits to flee.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-with-thomas-the-archdeacon">Dispute with Thomas the Archdeacon</h3>
<p>In 1230, Thomas was elected Archdeacon. He was frequently in conflict with Guncellus, who would grant clemency to those that Thomas tried to correct. Eventually the Archpriest Peter, a supporter of Guncellus, began to claim over the ecclesiastical duties that would normally belong to Thomas. The dispute went on nearly four years, sometimes resulting in physical conflict between supporters. Eventually the matter was taken to Rome. The matter was presided over by Otto of Tonengo in 1234 and sided with Thomas.</p>
<p>Guncellus would serve another eight years. the details of that time are omitted or forgotten. He passed away in 1242, having spent roughly 20 years as Archbishop.</p>
