  <p>This is part 22 in a series on Daniel Farlati&rsquo;s <a href="../../">Illyricum Sacrum</a>.</p>
<p>Saint Rayner (lt. Raynerius, hr. Arnir) was Archbishop of Spalato from 1176 to his martyrdom in 1180. Little is recorded of his time before becoming the Archbishop. He was previously bishop of Cagli (lt. Calliensis), Italy, and before that, a monk at Fonte Avellana. His acts and martyrdom as Archbishop of Spalato were recorded by Thomas the Archdeacon in <em>Historia Salonitana</em>.</p>
<h3 id="travel-with-alexander-iii">Travel with Alexander III</h3>
<p>Shortly after becoming bishop, Pope Alexander III traveled through Dalamatia on his way to make peace with Frederick Barbarossa in Venice. Rayner accompanied Alexander from Lissa to Zadar. A little while later, Alexander sends his legate Raymund De Capella to settle a jurisdictional dispute between Spalato and Zadar. Raymund writes a letter to the bishop of Zadar, inviting him to attend a council in Spalato. Farlati also includes Rayner in attendance at the Third Lateran Council in 1179. He publishes a letter From Rayner to his suffrage bishops encouraging them to join him in attending.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-with-manuel-i-komnenos">Meeting with Manuel I Komnenos</h3>
<p>In 1180 he traveled to Constantinople and met with Manuel I Komnenos. Upon returning to Spalato he dealt with a land dispute that ultimately ended in his death. One of the Croatian tribes had been inhabiting the area of Srinjine, that had been deeded to the church by King Zvonimir<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Farlati records a letter from Manuel to a Certain duke of Croatia named <em>Rogerius Sclavone</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> ordering that if Rayner can confirm that the region of Serengeni near Mount Masor is the property of the church then it should be returned to them.
Rayner convinces Roger that the church is the rightful owner. Roger issues a public letter attesting to the churchs property, and Rayner goes to the region to settle the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="martyrdom">Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Raynerius attempt to reclaim the land near Mount Masor was met with hostility from the Kačić tribe. When Rayner did not back down, claiming the terrority for the Church, the tribesmen stoned him to death.</p>
<p>Two miracles are said to have happened. As Rayner was hit with stones, he knelt down to pray, and his knees left an imprint in the stone. This stone was later cut from the rock and to church where Rayner was buried in Spalato. Farlati says the rock was still there in his day, and bore an inscrption</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hic est Lapis, supra quem Raynerius Sanctus genuflexionis signum reliquit: Corpus vero eius in hoc Sacello requiscit.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second miracle is that a spring with healing properties arose from the place that Rayner died. No later than the early 17th century a small church was built at the site of his death, and still stands to this day.</p>
<p>Rayner was buried at the church of Saint Benedict, which according to legend flung its doors open without human hands when the his body arrived. In the 17th century his relics were transferred due to the Cretan War. When the relics were returned it was said that a white dove landed on the high altar of the church and remained for some time. Farlati, writing less than 100 years after the events, lists the names of some clergy who saw the dove.</p>
<h3 id="canonization">Canonization</h3>
<p>Whether Rayner was actually canonized is subject to further research. In the 16th century Pope Sixtus V had him painted at the College of Saint Jerome. In 1613, Pope Paul V granted a seven year plenary indulgance for anyone who visited the church housing his relics on his feast day. Some sites say that he was recognized by Pope Alexander VIII in 1690, but would be surprising that Farlati does not mention the fact in his work.</p>
