  <p>This is part 23 in a series on Daniel Farlati&rsquo;s <a href="../../">Illyricum Sacrum</a>.</p>
<p>Bernard became Archbishop around 1198 A.D. The primary source on his life is Thomas the Archdeacon&rsquo;s <em>Historia Salonita</em>. He was well learned, said to have spent 30 years in Bologna before becoming being elected Archbishop. He was seen favorably by the Hungarian king Béla III, who had his son Emeric study under him. He reportedly wrote two books, now lost. One was on Heresies and another a collection of sermons.</p>
<p>One of his early acts of bishop was dealing with Catharism in Spalato. Two goldsmiths who had spent time in Bosnia had settled in Spalato and began to spread the heresy within the city. Bernard is said to have had them driven out of the city, and they repented as a result.</p>
<p>When Emeric became king of Hungary, he granted land to the church in Spalato. Emeric would later become involved in a civil war with his brother, Andrew. Emeric prevailed, but fell Ill and died soon after. Andrew soon gained the throne when Emeric&rsquo;s son, Ladislaus III, died unexpectedly less than a year later. Bernard remained in good favor with Andrew. As with previous kings, Farlati publishes a diploma from Andrew confirming the lands of the church in Spalato.</p>
<p>When the Venetians invaded Zadar, Bernard paid mercenaries to attack a venetian fort near the city. The Venetians retaliated by destroying a palace that had been built near the ruins of Salona.</p>
<p>Bernard was said to be in attendance at the Fourth Lateran Council, but his declining health prevented him from participating fully.</p>
<p>Bernard died around 1217. Andrew was in Spalato at the time, transporting his army to Jerusalem for a crusade. He attempted to have a new Archbishop installed but his nomination was rejected. Despite this, Farlati notes a donation of land from Andrew made to the church before he left town.</p>
