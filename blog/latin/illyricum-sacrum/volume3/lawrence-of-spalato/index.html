<meta name="title" content="Lawrence of Spalato" />
<meta name="description" content="This is part 20 in a series on Daniel Farlati&rsquo;s Illyricum Sacrum.
Lawrence (lt. Laurentius) was Archbishop of Spalato from 1060-1099 AD. The most detailed account comes from Thomas the Archdeacon&rsquo;s 13th century Historia Salonitana. Thomas describes him as an accomplished bishop who expanded the local church. Most notably was his commission of Adam of Paris to rewrite the acts of Domnius in to a modern vernacular.
Schism with Ulf
The Historia recounts that in the first part of Lawrence&rsquo;s ministry, a regional synod was held which banned the use of Slavonic1. A sympathizer of the Slavic priests named Ulf traveled to Rome and petitioned the Pope to reverse the decision. As Ulf was unknown to Rome, he was sent back with a request that the matter be handled between Rome and the bishops. Ulf returned to Dalmatia and conceiled Rome&rsquo;s request. He told the priests that they could reopen their churches and elect a bishop to represent them. Ulf returns to Rome with the elected bishop, named Cededas. He presents him as a presbyter seeking instruction. The Pope is suspicious of Cededas as he was not clean shaven. He cuts a few hairs from his beard and orders him shaved according to customs. Ulf deceived Cededas and told him that the Pope&rsquo;s action meant he had ordained him a bishop. When the Pope learned that Cededas was acting as bishop, He sent a Cardinal named John to Dalmatia to settle the matter. A council was held in Spalato. Ulf was deposed and thrown in Prison for 12 years." />

  <p>This is part 20 in a series on Daniel Farlati&rsquo;s <a href="../../">Illyricum Sacrum</a>.</p>
<p>Lawrence (lt. Laurentius) was Archbishop of Spalato from 1060-1099 AD. The most detailed account comes from Thomas the Archdeacon&rsquo;s 13th century <em>Historia Salonitana</em>. Thomas describes him as an accomplished bishop who expanded the local church. Most notably was his commission of Adam of Paris to rewrite the acts of <a href="../../volume1/domnius-bishop-of-salona">Domnius</a> in to a modern vernacular.</p>
<h3 id="schism-with-ulf">Schism with Ulf</h3>
<p>The <em>Historia</em> recounts that in the first part of Lawrence&rsquo;s ministry, a regional synod was held which banned the use of Slavonic<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A sympathizer of the Slavic priests named Ulf traveled to Rome and petitioned the Pope to reverse the decision. As Ulf was unknown to Rome, he was sent back with a request that the matter be handled between Rome and the bishops. Ulf returned to Dalmatia and conceiled Rome&rsquo;s request. He told the priests that they could reopen their churches and elect a bishop to represent them. Ulf returns to Rome with the elected bishop, named Cededas. He presents him as a presbyter seeking instruction. The Pope is suspicious of Cededas as he was not clean shaven. He cuts a few hairs from his beard and orders him shaved according to customs. Ulf deceived Cededas and told him that the Pope&rsquo;s action meant he had ordained him a bishop. When the Pope learned that Cededas was acting as bishop, He sent a Cardinal named John to Dalmatia to settle the matter. A council was held in Spalato. Ulf was deposed and thrown in Prison for 12 years.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-with-the-trpimirović-dynasty">Relationship with the Trpimirović dynasty</h3>
<p>Lawrence held the seat of Archbishop through the reigns of 3 Croatian kings: Krešimir, Zvonimir, and Stephen II. Zvonimir was particularly fond of Lawrence, who seems to have played a role in helping legitimize his reign. Of the nine donation diplomas<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that mention Lawrence, six come from Zvonimir.</p>
<h3 id="opposition-to-the-metropolitan-at-ragusa">Opposition to the metropolitan at Ragusa</h3>
<p>A letter dated to 1078 from Pope Gregory VII to King Michael Vojislavljević mentions a dispute between the bishop of Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik) and Spalato. Farlati infers that Michael had requested Ragusa become a metropolitan see. Lawrence objected to this as it would have diminished the power of Spalato&rsquo;s own metropolitan authority. No additional writings record the outcome of the dispute. However, Dubrovnik held the title of Archdiocese for several hundred years afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="confirmation-of-vekenegas-inheritance">Confirmation of Vekenega&rsquo;s inheritance</h3>
<p>Vekenega was a Nun at the monastery of St. Mary in Zadar. She became a Nun 20 years after the death of her husband, and was involved in a dispute over inheritance. Andrew, the bishop of Zadar, and Dragus, the Prior, adjudicated the matter. Lawrence wrote to confirm their ruling that Vekenega held the right to her inheritance.</p>
