Jordanes writing in the 6th century Romana: &ldquo;Nepos, having obtained the legitimate kingdom, expelled Glycerius, who had imposed the kingdom on himself in a tyrannical manner, from the Empire, and made him Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia&rdquo;
Evagrius Scholasticus in the 6th century Ecclesiastical History: &ldquo;After whom Glycerius became Emperor. After he was expelled, Nepos obtained the empire of the Romans for five years: and he ordained Glycerius Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia.&rdquo;
Paul the Deacon in the 7th century Historia Romana: &ldquo;Then, in the following year, Nepos unexpectedly arrived with an army, stripped Glycerius of royal power, and ordained him Bishop of Salona, a city in Dalmatia&rdquo;
No early writers leave details about his early life. Farlati cites the controversial Ivan Tomko Mrnavić who having read the works of Marcus Maruli claimed that Glycerius was born from a noble family in Salona. He also states to have seen an ancient manuscript from a certain Franciscus Turrigia which suggested Glycerius was not deposed but left voluntarily. Glycerius vero factus fuit Augustus a Gundibaldo Patrio, voluntate totius exercitus, sed postea nolens mundo militare reliquit imperium, et fult factus Episcopus in Salona Dalmatiae
Few references to his short Reign as emperor. Ennodius of Pavia writing in the early 6th century makes a brief favorable mention of him in his life of Epiphanius of Pavia,
section 3 deals reprints the life of glycerius as written by Ivan Tomko, he claims information from 3 sources: Vincentius de Franciscis, Marcus Marulus (that Glycerius was born a first class citizen in Salona) and Franciscus Turrigia (That Glycerius voluntarily abdicated as opposed to being deposed). Tomko paints a Glycerius in a postiive light saying that he received Julius Nepos in Salona when he fled there, allowing him to stay in the Diocletian Palace. Others have said that When Nepos attempted to raise an Army to retake Rome ~480, Glycerius was involved in the plot to murder him. Marcellinus says it was own men, Viatoris and Ovidae.

Arguments taken from Lactantius, with which both are attacked.
The Baluzian argument is dissolved, and Lactantius is reconciled with the Augustal marriage of St. Serena and with the Acts of St. Susanna.
Our interpretation is very much in line with Lactantius&rsquo; way of speaking.
The same explanation is based on the example and authority of Lacttantius&rsquo; interpreters.
Our interpretation is confirmed by the example of ancient authors, such as Lactantius and the authority of the aqualia.
The interpretation of Lactantius, used by his adversaries, diminishes and weakens the authority of sacred antiquity.
It is an insult to prefer the authority of the Lactantian Code to the Martyrologies and Acts of St. Susanna.

Hence arose the causes of the Papal Interregnum of Salona. On ecclesiastical matters, the see of Salona being vacant. Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, killed Odoacer, and having gained possession of Italy and Dalmatia, brought an end to the Papal interregnum. Notes on Glycerius Jordanes writing in the 6th century Romana: “Nepos, having obtained the legitimate kingdom, expelled Glycerius, who had imposed the kingdom on himself in a tyrannical manner, from the Empire, and made him Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia” Evagrius Scholasticus in the 6th century Ecclesiastical History: “After whom Glycerius became Emperor. After he was expelled, Nepos obtained the empire of the Romans for five years: and he ordained Glycerius Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia.” Paul the Deacon in the 7th century Historia Romana: “Then, in the following year, Nepos unexpectedly arrived with an army, stripped Glycerius of royal power, and ordained him Bishop of Salona, a city in Dalmatia” No early writers leave details about his early life. Farlati cites the controversial Ivan Tomko Mrnavić who having read the works of Marcus Maruli claimed that Glycerius was born from a noble family in Salona. He also states to have seen an ancient manuscript from a certain Franciscus Turrigia which suggested Glycerius was not deposed but left voluntarily. Glycerius vero factus fuit Augustus a Gundibaldo Patrio, voluntate totius exercitus, sed postea nolens mundo militare reliquit imperium, et fult factus Episcopus in Salona Dalmatiae Few references to his short Reign as emperor. Ennodius of Pavia writing in the early 6th century makes a brief favorable mention of him in his life of Epiphanius of Pavia, section 3 deals reprints the life of glycerius as written by Ivan Tomko, he claims information from 3 sources: Vincentius de Franciscis, Marcus Marulus (that Glycerius was born a first class citizen in Salona) and Franciscus Turrigia (That Glycerius voluntarily abdicated as opposed to being deposed). Tomko paints a Glycerius in a postiive light saying that he received Julius Nepos in Salona when he fled there, allowing him to stay in the Diocletian Palace. Others have said that When Nepos attempted to raise an Army to retake Rome ~480, Glycerius was involved in the plot to murder him. Marcellinus says it was own men, Viatoris and Ovidae.

Honorius became bishop in 493 Pope Galesius wrote a letter to Honorius in 493 because he had heard the pelagian heresy had begun to spread in Dalmatia. Church of Barcelona. A city otherwise unknown somewhere in Pannonia. Farlati cites Andreas of Zadar who provided the source for this fact at the second council of Salona in the 6th century. The slavonic Codex mentioned here is the Chronicle of the priest of Dioclea or Duklja. The chronicle details the history of the slavic kingdom and was composed in the 12th century.

It is more likely that Serena originated from Illyricum than from Spain. 5. The marriage of Diocletian and Serena, as well as the History of St. Susanna, is vindicated by the arguments presented. 480. Arguments taken from Lactantius, with which both are attacked. The Baluzian argument is dissolved, and Lactantius is reconciled with the Augustal marriage of St. Serena and with the Acts of St. Susanna. Our interpretation is very much in line with Lactantius’ way of speaking. The same explanation is based on the example and authority of Lacttantius’ interpreters. Our interpretation is confirmed by the example of ancient authors, such as Lactantius and the authority of the aqualia. The interpretation of Lactantius, used by his adversaries, diminishes and weakens the authority of sacred antiquity. It is an insult to prefer the authority of the Lactantian Code to the Martyrologies and Acts of St. Susanna. Another way to dilute the proposed argument.

Written in Bosnia and printed in Rome in 1631. It exists in that book, to which the title is prefixed by the same author: The Sacredness of Royal Illyrian Sanctity. 3. The Acts of St. Marcellus are vindicated by the Baronial Censors. 515. That the name of Marcellus should be retained everywhere. There is no reason why Baronius should deny the story of Cyriacus in Persia, or of Jobia, the daughter of King Saporis, who was freed from a demon by him. That there are no suppositions, which are mentioned about St. Artemia in the Acts of St. Marcellus. The name of Maximian, from which Baronius wished to be excommunicated, should not be removed from thenceforth.

The body of St. Gabinius is still in the temple of St. Susanna in Rome, and other cities falsely boast of his possession. St. Gabinus the Martyr, whose body is buried in the Vatican Basilica, is far different from St. Gabinius, priest and martyr, father of St. Susanna.

After he was expelled, Nepos obtained the empire of the Romans for five years: and he ordained Glycerius Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia.” Paul the Deacon in the 7th century Historia Romana: “Then, in the following year, Nepos unexpectedly arrived with an army, stripped Glycerius of royal power, and ordained him Bishop of Salona, a city in Dalmatia” No early writers leave details about his early life.

The interpretation of Lactantius, used by his adversaries, diminishes and weakens the authority of sacred antiquity.

Notes on Glycerius Jordanes writing in the 6th century Romana: “Nepos, having obtained the legitimate kingdom, expelled Glycerius, who had imposed the kingdom on himself in a tyrannical manner, from the Empire, and made him Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia” Evagrius Scholasticus in the 6th century Ecclesiastical History: “After whom Glycerius became Emperor. After he was expelled, Nepos obtained the empire of the Romans for five years: and he ordained Glycerius Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia.” Paul the Deacon in the 7th century Historia Romana: “Then, in the following year, Nepos unexpectedly arrived with an army, stripped Glycerius of royal power, and ordained him Bishop of Salona, a city in Dalmatia” No early writers leave details about his early life. Farlati cites the controversial Ivan Tomko Mrnavić who having read the works of Marcus Maruli claimed that Glycerius was born from a noble family in Salona. He also states to have seen an ancient manuscript from a certain Franciscus Turrigia which suggested Glycerius was not deposed but left voluntarily. Glycerius vero factus fuit Augustus a Gundibaldo Patrio, voluntate totius exercitus, sed postea nolens mundo militare reliquit imperium, et fult factus Episcopus in Salona Dalmatiae Few references to his short Reign as emperor. Ennodius of Pavia writing in the early 6th century makes a brief favorable mention of him in his life of Epiphanius of Pavia, section 3 deals reprints the life of glycerius as written by Ivan Tomko, he claims information from 3 sources: Vincentius de Franciscis, Marcus Marulus (that Glycerius was born a first class citizen in Salona) and Franciscus Turrigia (That Glycerius voluntarily abdicated as opposed to being deposed). Tomko paints a Glycerius in a postiive light saying that he received Julius Nepos in Salona when he fled there, allowing him to stay in the Diocletian Palace. Others have said that When Nepos attempted to raise an Army to retake Rome ~480, Glycerius was involved in the plot to murder him. Marcellinus says it was own men, Viatoris and Ovidae.

The marriage of Diocletian and Serena, as well as the History of St. Susanna, is vindicated by the arguments presented. 480. Arguments taken from Lactantius, with which both are attacked. The Baluzian argument is dissolved, and Lactantius is reconciled with the Augustal marriage of St. Serena and with the Acts of St. Susanna. Our interpretation is very much in line with Lactantius’ way of speaking. The same explanation is based on the example and authority of Lacttantius’ interpreters. Our interpretation is confirmed by the example of ancient authors, such as Lactantius and the authority of the aqualia. The interpretation of Lactantius, used by his adversaries, diminishes and weakens the authority of sacred antiquity. It is an insult to prefer the authority of the Lactantian Code to the Martyrologies and Acts of St. Susanna. Another way to dilute the proposed argument. Some other obstacles are removed that could be placed on Serena’s wedding. 6. On the death, burial, and relics of St. Serena. 499.

The Acts of St. Marcellus are vindicated by the Baronial Censors. 515. That the name of Marcellus should be retained everywhere. There is no reason why Baronius should deny the story of Cyriacus in Persia, or of Jobia, the daughter of King Saporis, who was freed from a demon by him. That there are no suppositions, which are mentioned about St. Artemia in the Acts of St. Marcellus. The name of Maximian, from which Baronius wished to be excommunicated, should not be removed from thenceforth. In the fourth and last paragraph of the Acts of St. Marcellus, no other person can be understood by the name of Maximian, except Maximianus the Severe. 4.

The body of St. Gabinius is still in the temple of St. Susanna in Rome, and other cities falsely boast of his possession. St. Gabinus the Martyr, whose body is buried in the Vatican Basilica, is far different from St. Gabinius, priest and martyr, father of St. Susanna. Notes on Gabinus primary source is from the Acts of Susanna. He is called the father of Susanna and the brother of Caius. Mentioned by Bede and Ado as the father of Susanna, omitted by Usuard.

<li>Evagrius Scholasticus in the 6th century <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>: &ldquo;After whom Glycerius became Emperor. After he was expelled, Nepos obtained the empire of the Romans for five years: and he ordained Glycerius Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Paul the Deacon in the 7th century <em>Historia Romana</em>: &ldquo;Then, in the following year, Nepos unexpectedly arrived with an army, stripped Glycerius of royal power, and ordained him Bishop of Salona, a city in Dalmatia&rdquo;</li>
<li>No early writers leave details about his early life. Farlati cites the controversial Ivan Tomko Mrnavić who having read the works of Marcus Maruli claimed that Glycerius was born from a noble family in Salona. He also states to have seen an ancient manuscript from a certain Franciscus Turrigia which suggested Glycerius was not deposed but left voluntarily. <em>Glycerius vero factus fuit Augustus a Gundibaldo Patrio, voluntate totius exercitus, sed postea nolens mundo militare reliquit imperium, et fult factus Episcopus in Salona Dalmatiae</em></li>
<li>Few references to his short Reign as emperor. Ennodius of Pavia writing in the early 6th century makes a brief favorable mention of him in his life of Epiphanius of Pavia,</li>
<li>section 3 deals reprints the life of glycerius as written by Ivan Tomko, he claims information from 3 sources: Vincentius de Franciscis, Marcus Marulus (that Glycerius was born a first class citizen in Salona) and Franciscus Turrigia (That Glycerius voluntarily abdicated as opposed to being deposed). Tomko paints a Glycerius in a postiive light saying that he received Julius Nepos in Salona when he fled there, allowing him to stay in the Diocletian Palace. Others have said that When Nepos attempted to raise an Army to retake Rome ~480, Glycerius was involved in the plot to murder him. Marcellinus says it was own men, Viatoris and Ovidae.

<li>Gregory the great sends several letters in an attempt to resolve the situation. Natalis is slow to respond and Gregory orders Honoratus restored to his position.</li>
<li>Gregory also sent letters concerning the bishop Florentinus, who Natalis deposed unlawfully by not calling for a council to review the matter.</li>
<li>Natalis died before any of his controversies were resolved. Honoratus was elected bishop. Another bishop, Malchus, managed to turn public opinion against him. Honoratus resigned in order to avoid a schism.</li>
